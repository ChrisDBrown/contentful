contentful
==========

Provides integrations with the Contentful APIs (Content Delivery and Content Management) for PHP 5.4+

Status: Content Delivery API support is complete. No integration with Content Management API yet - though work forthcoming and PRs welcome!

Will tag a 1.0 release (CDA support only) when sufficient documentation is written.
